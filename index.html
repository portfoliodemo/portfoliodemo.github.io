Assign virtually any element that you want to become a grid, and that element's direct descendants become grid-items, and provide the abilities to be moved and placed anywhere on the layout with relative ease and immense functionality. </p> -->

                    <!-- <h3>From Graph Paper to Grid</h3> -->

                    <p><span class="intro-paragraph">CSS Grid</span> - What is it? CSS Grid is an immensely powerful web layout tool that opens up a whole new world of design possibilities, taking us from the mundane to the magnificent with only a few simple lines of code.</p>
                    
                    <p>Grid allows for the simplest or most complex websites to be built and deployed with relative ease, all while enhancing separation of concerns and improving accessibility. Wow, sounds great!! Sign me up!! Now if only I knew how to do all of those things.</p>
                    
                    <h3>From Graph Paper to Grid</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a sheet of graph paper, better yet if you happen to have one close by, go and grab it, don't worry if it will take you a few minutes, I'll wait here until your back. (No really it's fine, I'm going to put the kettle on for a proper cup anyways..) </p>
                    <p>Got the graph paper? Great, it's really helpful for sketching out layout and grid ideas! Wait, you don't have it? Well which is it? Never mind, there is a grid below we can use for our purposes. </p>
                    <p>Start off by taking a long look at the following graph below or by visualizing one in your mind, and imagining all of the infinite <!-- web-layout -->possibilities that could be created.. </p>

                    <p>Now you understand CSS Grid!! Awesome right?! Thanks for reading! <span class="custom-caption">Stay tuned next week as we tackle time and space complexity! ;)</span></p>
                    
                    <h3>Giddy About Grid</h3>
                    <p>All joking aside, CSS Grid is a tool that can unleash all sorts of powerful customizations, so much so that I almost don't really know where to start when trying to talk about it! There are so many cool layouts and opportunities made available thanks to all of the great properties and features of CSS Grid, it is really exciting!! You know when your binging on development docs your excited.</p>
                    <p>So what kind of setup is required when you want to start making and using a grid, or in many cases, grids? Well it's pretty simple to get up and running, you just select virtually any element from your html that you want to become a grid, and you set it's display property to grid, as in this CSS example shown below:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>Okay cool! So now we now have an element declared as a grid (our element here is a div, but again you can use virtually any html element to become a grid), and our element belongs to the class called my-awesome-site. In this case, we are going to use our grid as a container for the main portion of our site where we play around with some of the properties of Grid such as columns and rows and gaps.</p>
                    
                    <p>A key point to remember is that only the <strong>direct/first-level descendant(s)</strong> of an element with <strong>display: grid</strong> will inherently become a grid item or items.<!-- Maybe break here, unorderlist to demo inheritance --> So it's important to keep those relationships in mind as you are developing your site and building out your grids. As we dig a little deeper hopefully this will become clearer. Now is probably a perfect time to brainstorm some web layout demo ideas!</p>

                    <!-- An Unordered List here could demonstrate the first level descendants constraint well.. -->

                    <p>While a one column layout may be just what you need, and that's effectively all that's created when you initally declare an element as a grid (items will still be laid out in normal flow just the same as before declaring a grid), for demonstration sake that's not exactly ideal. So let's go ahead and start off our demo by creating a three column grid!</p>

                    <h3>From Grid to Great</h3>
                    <p>We can create a basic three column grid by simply utilizing a property called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns" alt="Mozilla Developer Documentation on Grid-Template-Columns" target="_blank">grid-template-columns</a>, along with a value containing any length measurement you'd like, pixels (px), ems (em), fractions (fr), whatever suits your situation at any given moment.</p>
                    
                    <!-- <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-columns: 30em 300px 10vw;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div> -->

                    <p>In this case we will be using fr, which stands for fraction and assigns all of the available space to that portion of the grid based on the fraction. Here's an example of what CSS might be needed to setup a basic three column layout:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>Alright! Now we are definitely gettin' griddy with it. We've declared our grid container, and defined a three column layout within it, with the middle column taking up half of the available space.</p>
                    
                    <p>Seeing the CSS in action along with some html markup will really help to showcase what's happening here. So without further ado let's go ahead and setup a skeleton demo and start having even more fun with grid! Queue the montage! (Just kidding, there's no montage, yet..)</p>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1deskiRFaU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <!-- Resume after first video here -->
                    <!-- <h3>Row, Row, Row Your Grid</h3> -->
                    <h3>Column to an End</h3>
                    <p>Our basic grid has been setup and we now have three columns we can play around with. We could have just as easily setup our three columns to become two, or five, or twelve columns, all really up to you to use however you want, demonstrating the flexibility of not only Grid in general, but also of its many specific properties as well!</p>
                
                    <p>So again using only grid-template-columns, we could also write something like:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>or:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>Whoa what's up with the repeat function lookin' thingy?! Twelve comma one fr? What on Mars is that supposed to mean!? Wait..<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" target="_blank">..Mars?</a> Awesome. So your telling me your just going to lazily create twelve repeating columns, specifiying each one to take up just one fraction of the available space, just like that? Sweet!!</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether or not you need a gazillion columns or rows will ultimately be up to you, but perhaps more often than not sticking with a simple column and row structure, and nesting grids if needed, will yield excellent results.</p>

                    <p>We are cruising along now, we have our demo setup and we've had somewhat of a column smorgasbord and we are ready to move on to rows! Are you telling me you are this far into the project, potentially over your limit and all you have really mentioned so far is grid and grid-template-columns, really? Yes, yes I am.</p>

                    <h3>Row, Row, Row Your Grid!</h3>
                    <p>Forget columns! It's time to Rock n' Row! Apologies to my classmates (and instructor!) of INTP-362 who have to read this!! =) Thank you for your patience, help, and forgiveness! ;) </p>

                    <p>To start placing rows into our demo we are going to take advantage of <strong>grid-template-rows</strong>. Similar to grid-template columns but now we are essentially placing rows along the 'y-axis' if you will, whereas with columns we were working across the 'x-axis'. While we're on the subject, we can also utilize the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index" target="_blank">z-index</a> to stack items however we see fit as well! Opening up another near infinite amount of design possibilites as we are essentially able to create in 3D! But for now, back to rows!</p>

                    <p>If we were trying to create three rows we could set something up very similar to our column code, only this time it could look like:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div> 
                    
                    <p>While the syntax is very similar to grid-template-columns, there are some subtle differences that have to be taken into account when differentiating between the two. Wait, is there? Are you sure? No I'm not actually, not at all, upon closer inspection they look almost identical if I'm not mistaken?</p>
                    
                    <p>We can definitely combine columns and rows together to help define our layouts even more. So combining our code examples from earlier, we could set up something like the following:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">.my-awesome-site {</span>
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">display: grid;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-css-rule">grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr;</span>    
                        <span class="snippet-class-name">}</span>
                    </div> 
                    
                    <p>Yeah, now that you mention it, grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows are pretty similar, which leads me to wonder, how <strong>did</strong> they really build the pyramids? Or perhaps an even more important question to ask, is <strong>why</strong> did they build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" target="_blank">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>?</p> 

                    <!-- Pyramid grid/ideas go here -->

                    <!-- <div class="pyramid-small"></div>
                    <div class="pyramid-med"></div> -->
                    <div class="pyramid-cheops"></div>               
                    
                    <h3>A Heiroglyphic-less Tomb?</h3>
                    <p>General consensus seems to be that the pyramids were built to be tombs, but a potential wrinkle in that well established theory is that there is almost no heiroglyphics anywhere in the pyramids at Giza, aside from some small markings believed to have been left by workmen in the pyramid of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu" target="_blank">Khufu</a>, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" target="_blank">Great Pyramid</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whereas roughly 665km south of Giza on the western bank of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile">Nile</a> opposite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor" target="_blank">Luxor</a>, a vast majority of Pharoahs and royals are buried in elaborate tombs and tunnels known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings" target="_blank">Valley of the Kings</a>. Nearly every tomb is intricately decorated from floor to ceiling on almost every wall with heiroglyphics, ensuring the occupier of the tomb would be well suited to journey through the many challenges of the afterlife safely, according to ancient Egyptian beliefs. One of the many well-known Pharoahs buried there was a young boy known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun" target="_blank">Tutankhamun</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Gridding Back on Track</h3>
                    <p>So about those row/column differences? A good dig through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns" target="_blank">grid-template-columns</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows" target="_blank">grid-template-rows</a> on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> site should clarify any differences if you can spot them! Shout out to Mozilla for being so awesome and helping everyone learn so much! Kudos Mozilla!!</p>

                    <p>Speaking of "track", tracks are how the rows and columns that we define are referred to. To go back way up to our first example, we had three columns, or three "tracks", that we set to 1fr 2fr 1fr, and then eventually three rows that we also set to the same values. So what does that end up looking like, and how do we create space between the column and row tracks?</p>

                    <p>Before getting off track anymore with random tangents, let's jump back into a video for a wrap up of what we've covered and a glimpse into gaps within a grid!</p>

                    <p>We're not getting paid by the word here so for everyones sake we should probably move on.</p>


                    <p>Columns are great, but rows are just so much more, ..rowy, ya know? Umm, no I don't know because "rowy" isn't a word. At least not in our context, as apparently in northern Poland there is a lovely little village called "Rowy". For our purposes here we can conclude rowy falls into the category of je ne sais quoi. This is ridiculous, not only is this way off topic, but now your dropping french while you seemingly reminisce about rows? I'm pretty sure you don't even speak french? Well I'm pretty sure I'll be cutting this part out!</p>

                    <!-- Embed youtube video here, demoing the three divs. Focus will be to setup the files, create a basic three column grid, then back to the blog to talk about grid rows and grid gap..-->

                    <p>So we have our container, which won't really change anything on our layout, as it effectively just creates a one column grid, so to see the magic of Grid we are going to introduce another property which allows us to create as many columns as we want within our site.</p>

                    <p>CSS Grid - What is it? Well a grid is fairly self explanatory I think, if I say grid you think of..? Graph paper? Perfect! Go grab some if you've got it, no worries if not. Alright, now that we have a sheet of graph paper, either literally and or figuratively, imagine you are getting ready to design your awesome blog all about.. v-neck sweaters, (wait, are you serious?).. of course not, not just any v-neck sweaters, but only red one's that really wrap around your neck to remind yourself of the choking pressure of the holidays. Ouch man you really need to get out more. </p>

                    <p>Imagine a sheet of graph paper, now focus in on one single square on the graph paper, from that one square what if we were able to extend horizontally or vertically as many rows or columns as you want? That is what CSS Grid allows us to do. We can literally draw any layout we want on graph paper, and section out our elements so that they are easily placed wherever we want them with no change to the HTML markup.</p>

                    <p>Hello! Throughout this blog I'll be attempting to deconstruct and learn as much as I can about CSS Grids! Hopefully you come across something fun and interesting as well, maybe even educational too! No promises though! =)</p>

                    <p>So what exactly is CSS Grid? Well, to be honest, at the moment, I can't really definitively say. Wow, what a jerk, you mean to tell me your writing a blog about CSS Grid and its going to be completely void of any useful information pertaining to the subject? Whoa, now c'mon that's a bit harsh, but hang on a minute, I might have something to contribute, going to read a few books, paruse a few sites etc, be right back..</p>

                    <h3>Grids, Glorious Grids!</h3>
                    <p>So what exactly are grids and why are they so awesome? Well, imagine you are tasked with creating a layout that some trendy new hipster from the design department has drawn up, created in some psychadellic euphoria with elements overlapping elements no doubt. How are you supposed to take this dahli-esque layout and convert it into a website? Tables?! Flexbox?! Multi-column?! Oh man, they don't pay you enough right? I can't take any more ramen noodles, SAIT had promised.. nevermind that's beside the point right now. So what do you do? Do you head down to that design department to crush this poor idealistic day dreamer's dreams that his funky design that he conjured up while spaced out will never see the light of day, much like him? Perhaps our past predecessors may have taken that limiting route, but we are not ones to crush a dream are we? No way, let's grab some tye-dye and head down to work with our new far out friend, showing him that we can indeed create his wacked out wireframe of a demo, all thanks to the glorious power of grids. Now, who would like a slice? &#x1F355; Whoa, that's pretty cheesy.. </p>

                    <h3>Sketching Out A Design</h3>
                    <p>Okay, let’s imagine you have to write a blog for work or school or even better for your own fun and enjoyment. How would you go about creating the layout for this blog? What would it look like? Well if you did happen to grab that sheet of grid paper now is the time to sketch out your basic design. No holds barred, however you want your blog to look is up to you, I’m going to do the same as well.</p>
                    <p>But first, before we sketch out our initial design, let’s talk about some of the things that might go into a blog, and what sort of features or elements are we going to include in our site? Well, we’re going to need a blog first and foremost, but along with our main content, what will we include? Perhaps a header and a navigation bar, maybe even a sidebar or an aside to provide relevant/contrasting information. Cap off the layout with a footer and we have the building block of our blog! Here’s a look at my initial sketch, how is yours looking so far? </p>

                    <h3>Grid Terminology</h3>
                    <p>Lots of terms relating to grids, but luckily for us as they have evolved the names have gone from things like grid-column-gap to just gap. Which is kinda good and bad depending on how you look at it, even both probably.</p>
